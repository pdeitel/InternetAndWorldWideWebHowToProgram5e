         <h2>Results from our Facebook Survey</h2>
         <p>If you were a nonprogrammer about to learn Java for the first 
            time, would you prefer a course that taught Java in the 
            context of Android app development? Here are the results from 
            our survey:</p>
            
            <!-- meter element represents a scale within a range -->
            0 <meter min = "0"
            max = "54"
            value = "14"></meter> 54
         <p>Of the 54 responders, 14 (green) would prefer to
         learn Java in the context of Android app development.</p>
